# Java Basics
## History
## Java History

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that was designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It was originally developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s.

### Origins

Java's development began in 1991 as part of the "Green Project" at Sun Microsystems. The goal was to create a language that could be used to program a wide range of consumer electronic devices. Initially, the language was called **Oak**, named after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling‚Äôs office. However, the name was later changed to **Java**, inspired by Java coffee, due to a trademark issue with the name Oak.

### Public Release

Java was officially released in **1995** with the slogan **"Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA)**. This concept highlighted Java‚Äôs key feature: the ability to run the same program on different platforms without modification, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

---

### üß† Tip

If you install the JDK, you **automatically get the JRE** bundled with it.

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

- **JDK = JRE + development tools**
- If you're coding in Java, install the JDK.
- If you're only running Java apps, JRE is sufficient (but often bundled automatically).


## Java Distribution

### What Is a Java Distribution?

A **Java distribution** is a packaged version of the Java platform that includes the Java Development Kit (JDK) and sometimes additional tools, libraries, and support for various platforms and use cases.

Different organizations and vendors provide their own Java distributions, each tailored with different features, licenses, and support options. These distributions are based on the **OpenJDK** project, which is the open-source reference implementation of Java.

---

### Why Are There Multiple Java Distributions?

- **Licensing:** Oracle JDK used to be the primary distribution, but licensing changes led many to adopt open-source or vendor-specific builds.
- **Support & Updates:** Some vendors offer long-term support (LTS), security patches, and performance improvements.
- **Additional Tools:** Certain distributions bundle extra tools or enhancements specific to enterprise or cloud environments.
- **Platform Optimization:** Some builds are optimized for specific operating systems or hardware.

---

### Popular Java Distributions

## Java Platform Independence

### What Is Platform Independence?

**Platform independence** means that Java programs can run on any device or operating system without needing to be rewritten or recompiled for each platform.

This is one of Java‚Äôs most important features, often summarized by the slogan:

> **"Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA)**

---

### How Does Java Achieve Platform Independence?

Java achieves platform independence through the use of:

- **Java Source Code (`.java` files):** Written by developers, platform-neutral.
- **Java Compiler (`javac`):** Compiles source code into **bytecode** (`.class` files), which is not specific to any hardware or OS.
- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM):** An interpreter that runs the bytecode on the underlying hardware and operating system.

The JVM is platform-specific ‚Äî there is a different JVM implementation for Windows, macOS, Linux, etc. But the bytecode remains the same across all platforms.

---

### Why Is This Important?

- **Portability:** Developers don‚Äôt need to write different versions of their program for each platform.
- **Efficiency:** Saves time and resources since one compiled program can run everywhere.
- **Security:** JVM acts as a sandbox, controlling program execution and preventing unsafe operations.
- **Consistency:** Ensures the same behavior of Java programs regardless of where they run.

## OOPS: Object Oriented Programming

---

### 1. Class

A **class** is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) common to all objects of that type. It represents a concept or a thing.

- Think of a class as a blueprint for creating objects.
- Classes encapsulate data for the object and methods to manipulate that data.

### Example:

```java
class Dog {
    // Attributes (properties)
    String breed;
    int age;
    String color;

    // Behavior (method)
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof! Woof!");
    }
}
```


### Object
An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created.

- Objects have states and behaviors defined by their class.

- Each object can have different values for its attributes.


```java
Dog myDog = new Dog();  // Creating an object of class Dog
myDog.breed = "Labrador";
myDog.age = 5;
myDog.color = "Black";
myDog.bark();  // Output: Woof! Woof!
```

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the mechanism of restricting direct access to some of an object‚Äôs components and protecting the internal state of the object. This is done by:

- Declaring variables as private.
- Providing public getter and setter methods to access and update the value.

Benefits:

- Protects data integrity by controlling how it‚Äôs accessed or modified.
- Improves maintainability and flexibility.

```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Getter method for name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter method for name
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getter method for age
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Setter method for age
    public void setAge(int age) {
        if(age > 0) {  // validation
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
}
```

### Inheritance
Inheritance allows a new class (subclass or child class) to acquire the properties and behaviors of an existing class (superclass or parent class).

Benefits:

- Promotes code reuse.
- Establishes a natural hierarchical relationship.  

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}

public class TestInheritance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.eat();  // Inherited method
        myDog.bark(); // Dog's own method
    }
}
```

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms". It allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions.

Types:

- Method Overloading: Same method name, different parameter lists within the same class (compile-time polymorphism).

```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}
```

- Method Overriding: Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass (runtime polymorphism).

```java
class Bird {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Some sound");
    }
}

class Parrot extends Bird {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Squawk");
    }
}

public class TestPolymorphism {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bird myBird = new Parrot();
        myBird.sound();  // Output: Squawk
    }
}
```

### Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features to the user.

- Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

- Helps to reduce complexity and isolate impact of changes.

```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void move();

    void stop() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle stopped.");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void move() {
        System.out.println("Car is moving");
    }
}

public class TestAbstraction {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle myCar = new Car();
        myCar.move();  // Output: Car is moving
        myCar.stop();  // Output: Vehicle stopped.
    }
}
```

### Summary
- Class: Blueprint for objects.

- Object: Instance of a class.

- Encapsulation: Data hiding using private variables and public methods.

- Inheritance: Creating new classes from existing ones.

- Polymorphism: Many forms of methods (overloading and overriding).

- Abstraction: Hiding complexity using abstract classes/interfaces.

        student1.setStudentId(1001);
        student1.setQualifyingMarks(80.0f);
        student1.setYearOfEngineering(3);
        student1.setResidentialStatus('H');

        System.out.println("Student Name       :   " + student1.getStudentName());
        System.out.println("Student Id         :   " + student1.getStudentId());
        System.out.println("Qualifying marks   :   " + student1.getQualifyingMarks());
